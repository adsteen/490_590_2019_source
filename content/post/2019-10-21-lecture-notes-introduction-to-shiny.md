# Resources

* [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) by Hadley Wickham.
    - Note that this textbook is early in development. The entire text is [on Github](https://github.com/hadley/mastering-shiny). If you can think of an improvement, fork it, make the change, and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!
* Shiny cheat sheet at [RStudio cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) (.pdf)
* [Shiny apps gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/). Note that for each app, there's a link to the underlying code, e.g. [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/master/051-movie-explorer).
* [Shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/), which will host your shiny apps for free on the web (as long as too many people don't use them.)
