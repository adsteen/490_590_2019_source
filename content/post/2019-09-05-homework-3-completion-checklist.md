The completion checklist that I will hand out is posted [here](hmk_03_evaluation.pdf).

Please note that in the future we will get strict about the style guide, but at the moment I would just like you to generally write your code in a legible way (appropriate spacing between blocks of code, avoid wacky line breaks and terrible variable names, etc).

Finally note that, in general, the homework rubrics will be the same:

* Does the code work?
* Is it elegant?
