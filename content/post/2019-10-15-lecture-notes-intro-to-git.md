# Resources

The resources I'm listing are better than any notes I would post, so I refer you to them for this lesson.

* Software Carpentry's [git lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
* As a reminder, Software Carpentry's [the Unix (bash) shell lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
* Jenny Bryan's extensive [Happy git with R guide](https://happygitwithr.com/), which contains a lot of practical detail about setting up git and connecting it with GitHub. Some particularly important sections:
    - [Philosophy and practical advice on git clients](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html) (like [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), which I'm using)
    - [Connecting to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html) 
    - [Setting up credentials for HTTPS](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html) so you can connect automatically
* GitHub's [list of guides](https://guides.github.com/) to get started with git and GitHub.

# Looking forward

Our next lesson set is about [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), a system to make graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in R. Many of you will be using shiny for your final projects.

If you'd like to include shiny in your final project, I recommend looking at Hadley Wickham's early draft of a [shiny textbook](https://mastering-shiny.org/), as well as the RStudio's [shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) to get a sense of what shiny is and how it works.
