<h1>Resources</h1>
<p>The this is the set of notes for the classroom exercise of building a shiny app that dynamically creates plots of the diamonds data set.</p>
<p>The aim is to create a shiny app that does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes a dynamic plot of the <code>diamonds</code> data set</li>
<li>Allows the user to select the range of <code>carat</code> that is being plotted</li>
<li>Allows the user to select which variables to map to the x, y and color aesthetics of the plot
<ul>
<li>Hint: use <code>aes_string()</code> instead of <code>aes</code> here</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Only updates the plot when the user presses ‘go’ (an <code>actionButton()</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A final(-ish) version of the app can be seen at its <a href="https://github.com/adsteen/shiny_diamonds">github repository</a>. Note that You can also play with the app at <a href="https://adsteen.shinyapps.io/diamonds_exercise/">shinyapps.io</a></p>
<p>I encourage you to build up the app in the following order (note that we did steps 1-3 in class):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start with the auto-generated app that RStudio creates when you choose New Project -&gt; New Shiny App</li>
<li>Remove the plot code in the auto-generated <code>server</code>, and change the title and slider to a range slider.</li>
<li>Create a non-reactive plot in the plot window.</li>
<li>Put some code in to filter diamonds based on the value of the slider
<ul>
<li>Note 1: Consider putting this code in a <strong>reactive expression</strong> using the <code>reactive()</code> function. Read more about these in <a href="https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#reactive-expressions-1">Mastering Shiny</a></li>
<li>Note 2: Keep in mind that reactive expressions don’t return the object you want - they return a function to get the object that you want. So you might end up writing code like:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>filtered_data &lt;- reactive({
  diamonds %&gt;%
      filter(some code here)
})</code></pre>
<p>and then</p>
<pre><code>ggplot(filtered_data(), aes_string(some code)) </code></pre>
Note the parentheses after <code>filtered_data()</code>!</li>
<li>Create <code>selectInput()</code>s or <code>radioButton()</code>s to choose the columns that will be mapped to x, y, and color</li>
<li>Make the plot reactive (without a Go button)</li>
<li><p>Make the plot so that it doesn’t react until the Go button is pressed</p></li>
</ol>
