The this is the set of notes for the classroom exercise of building a shiny app that dynamically creates plots of the diamonds data set.

The aim is to create a shiny app that does the following:

* Makes a dynamic plot of the `diamonds` data set
* Allows the user to select the range of `carat` that is being plotted
* Allows the user to select which variables to map to the x, y and color aesthetics of the plot
    * Hint: use `aes_string()` instead of `aes` here
* Only updates the plot when the user presses 'go' (an `actionButton()`)

A final(-ish) version of the app can be seen at its [github repository](https://github.com/adsteen/shiny_diamonds). Note that  You can also play with the app at [shinyapps.io](https://adsteen.shinyapps.io/diamonds_exercise/)

I encourage you to build up the app in the following order (note that we did steps 1-3 in class):

1. Start with the auto-generated app that RStudio creates when you choose New Project -> New Shiny App
2. Remove the plot code in the auto-generated `server`, and change the title and slider to a range slider.
3. Create a non-reactive plot in the plot window.
4. Put some code in to filter diamonds based on the value of the slider
    * Note 1: Consider putting this code in a **reactive expression** using the `reactive()` function. Read more about these in [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#reactive-expressions-1)
    * Note 2: Keep in mind that reactive expressions don't return the object you want - they return a function to get the object that you want. So you might end up writing code like:
    ```
    filtered_data <- reactive({
      diamonds %>%
          filter(some code here)
    })
    ```
    and then
    
    ```
    ggplot(filtered_data(), aes_string(some code)) 
    ```
    
    Note the parentheses after `filtered_data()`!
5. Create `selectInput()`s or `radioButton()`s to choose the columns that will be mapped to x, y, and color
6. Make the plot reactive (without a Go button)
7. Make the plot so that it doesn't react until the Go button is pressed
