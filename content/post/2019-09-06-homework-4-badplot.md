# It's the most wonderful time of the year

Homework 4 is simple: Considering what you have learned from Kieran Healy and Claus Wilke about what makes a good data visualization, **use ggplot2 and any data you choose to make the worst data visualization you can**.

Before the start of class on Friday, upload a .png file of your plot to [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/37V3Fk1X7wq4QNYF4rbX). The plot should be roughly 5 inches wide by 4 inches high, encoded at 300 dpi.

Also, have on your computer an R script to that produces the plot from raw data, written in good style according to our [style guide](../../../09/03/geol-490-590-style-guide/index.html). Your group members will confirm that your plot code works and is written in good style. **The entire plot must be generated from your code: modifications of the plot in Illustrator, for instance, will not be permissable**

Be prepared to speak very briefly on what your plot is, and why it is bad. After these presentations, we will vote on the worst plots. The winner will attain eternal glory, and everyone else will wish they had made a worse plot.
