# Resources

* Advanced R chapter on [S3](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html), from which this lesson is taken more-or-less directly.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sloop)
```

```{r}
f <- factor(c("a", "b", "c"))

typeof(f)
#> [1] "integer"
attributes(f)
#> $levels
#> [1] "a" "b" "c"
#> 
#> $class
#> [1] "factor"
```
